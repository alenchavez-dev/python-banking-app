# 🏦 Python Banking App

A simple console-based banking application built with **Python**.  
This project simulates a basic banking system with secure PIN hashing, account creation, checking/savings transactions, CSV transaction logging, and basic statistics.  

It was originally developed as part of a college course and later refactored and expanded to demonstrate clean code structure and practical security practices.
